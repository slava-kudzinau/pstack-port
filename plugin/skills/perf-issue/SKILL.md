# Perf issue

**You own the measurement story. Plan, review, verify the numbers.** Tie every fix to a measurement, don't read source instead of measuring.

1. Capture a baseline trace with the tool matching the surface: `bash` for a CLI or TUI, `browser` for a web or Electron UI, `debug` for a running process. Vet the baseline, and each later number, with `skill://benchmark-checklist`.
2. `skill://how` to ground hypotheses. Don't claim a perf ceiling without running it first.
   Try the performance mantras in order, cheapest first:
   1. Don't do it. Stop work whose result nothing uses rather than cheapening it.
   2. Do it, but don't do it again.
   3. Do it less.
   4. Do it later.
   5. Do it when they're not looking.
   6. Do it concurrently.
   7. Do it cheaper.

   When an earlier mantra meets the target, stop.
3. Plan the fix from the trace. If it crosses a function boundary, `skill://architect` first. Delegate implementation to a subagent via the `task` tool using the caller's configured process/code model role (default `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`). Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section in skill://poteto-mode. Review the diff. Capture a post-fix trace.
   Apply `skill://principle-sequence-verifiable-units`, verifying each attempt before trying the next.
4. Parse and compare the artifacts (JSON to sqlite, diff). "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
5. Cite the measurement in the PR.
6. Run `skill://opening-a-pr`.

For sustained improvement against a metric rather than a one-off fix, use `skill://hillclimb`.

**Reply:** baseline number, post-fix number, delta, artifact path.
